It is one of my favourite cake to eat as well as bake. It is decadent and fudgy and tasty for sure. 
I am sure you will enjoy baking, decorating and eating this cake.

Ingredients:

Cooking spray
4 c. all-purpose flour
2 cup. granulated sugar
1 cup. pacupked brown sugar
2 1/4 cup. Dutch-processed cocoa powder
3 tsp. baking soda
3 tsp. baking powder
Pinch of kosher salt
1 1/2 cup. melted butter
6 large eggs, lightly beaten
2 1/2 cup. strong black coffee
2 1/2 cup. buttermilk
1 tbsp. pure vanilla extract

FOR THE FROSTING
3 cup. butter, softened
7 1/2 cup. powdered sugar
2 1/4 cup. cocoa powder
1 tbsp. pure vanilla extract
Pinch of kosher salt
3/4 cup. heavy cream (plus more if necessary)
4 cup. semisweet chocolate chips, divided

DIRECTIONS:
Preheat oven to 350°. 
Line three 8” round cake pans with parchment and grease with cooking spray.
Make cake: 
In a large bowl, whisk together flour, sugars, cocoa powder, baking soda, baking powder, and salt. 
In another large bowl, whisk together melted butter, eggs, coffee, buttermilk, and vanilla. 
Gradually whisk dry ingredients into wet ingredients until smooth.
Divide batter evenly among the cake pans.
 Bake until a toothpick inserted into center comes out clean, about 35 minutes.
 Let cool completely on wire racks before removing from pans.

Meanwhile, make frosting:
 In a large bowl using a hand mixer, beat butter, powdered sugar, cocoa powder, vanilla, and salt. Beat in heavy cream 
 (adding more by the tablespoon until consistency is creamy but can hold peaks).

 How to frost:
Frost cake between layers, and then cover the entire cake with frosting.
Using your hands, cover the entire cake with 3 cups chocolate chips, using more if needed. 
In the microwave, melt remaining 1 cup chocolate chips, then drizzle melted chocolate over cake and serve.
